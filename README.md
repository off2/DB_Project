# FaceSpace - Social Network

The primary goal of this project is to implement a single Java application program that will
operate Social@Panther, a Social Networking System for the University of Pittsburgh. The core
of such a system is a database system. The secondary goal is to learn how to work as a member of
a team which designs and develops a relatively large, real database application.

## Getting Started

You must implement your application program using Java, Oracle, and JDBC. The assignment
focuses on the database component and not on the user interface. Hence, NO HTML or other graphical
user interface is required for this project.

### Prerequisites

The following software is required to run this project

```
Java 1.6.0_37
SQL*Plus
```

The following software is optional to generate sample data, though sample data is provided

```
Python 2.6.1
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
